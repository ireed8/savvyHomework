# Create a new file in your Homework Repo

1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your homework Repo, then Class Activities
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `3.1.5-FunctionsAndScope.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

// wrap the code below in a function called "addNumbersFrom1To100" and return the total
// ! do not use console.log inside your function

let total = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  total += i;
}

// invoke the function and console.log its value

// try to print the variable "total" outside the function
// ? what do you expect ?

// examine the code below,
// ? which console.log statement will not print when you invoke the parentAndChildScope function ?
function childScope(param) {
  const childVariable = "I am in the child's scope";
  console.log("Child Scope, Parent Variable:", param);
  console.log("Child Scope, Child Variable:", childVariable);
}

function parentAndChildScope() {
  const parentVariable = "I am in the parent's scope";
  childScope(parentVariable);
  console.log("Parent Scope, Parent Variable:", parentVariable);
  console.log("Parent Scope, Child Variable:", childVariable);
}

## While you are working, you can see what is printed to the console by typing `node 3.1.5-FunctionsAndScope.js` in the terminal

## When this activity is finished, push your work up to GitHub

1. Type `git add 3.1.5-FunctionsAndScope.js` in your terminal
2. Type `git status`
3. Type `git commit -m "Functions and Scope"`
4. Type `git status`
5. Type `git push`
