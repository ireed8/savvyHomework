1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your homework Repo, then Class Activities
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `3.1.2-FunctionInvocation.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

// print the function below
function myNumberFunction() {
  let num = 2 ** 2;
  num = num + 3;
  num = num % 4;
  num = num * 14;
  console.log(num);
}

// now, invoke the myNumberFunction function

// print just the function of console.log (no invocation)

## While you are working, you can see what is printed to the console by typing `node 3.1.2-FunctionInvocation.js` in the terminal
