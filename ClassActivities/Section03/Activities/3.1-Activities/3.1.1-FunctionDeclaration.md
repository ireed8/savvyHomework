1. Go to your terminal
2. Navigate to your homework Repo, then Class Activities
3. If development is not in parenthesis, type `git switch development` in your terminal
4. Open VS Code by typing `code .`
5. Create a new file called `3.1.1-FunctionDeclaration.js`
    1. The file name is one word
    2. The suffix is .js because the activity is JavaScript

## Copy the following into the blank file:

// TODO: using the function expressions below, refactor them into function declarations
const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};

const threeModTwo = function() {
  console.log(3 % 2);
};

let age = 18;
const checkDrivingAge = function() {
  if (age >= 16) {
    console.log(true);
  } else {
    console.log(false);
  }
};

## While you are working, you can see what is printed to the console by typing `node 3.1.1-FunctionDeclaration.js` in the terminal

1. Type `git add 3.1.1-FunctionDeclarations.js` in your terminal
2. Type `git status`
3. Type `git commit -m "Function Declarations"`
